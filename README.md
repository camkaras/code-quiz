# code-quiz

In this project I am tasked with creating a code quiz on javascript fundamentals. 

I have struggled a lot for this project and Im happy with what I have completed even though not every part of the acceptance criteria has been met. 
I added a feature to my quiz that turns the answer colour from purple to red or green depending on whether the user has selected the correct answer or not. 

I was unable to complete the highscore page or display the users score on the endpage.
